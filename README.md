FIXES TO MAKE:

- Change max radioactivity level, it currently max's out at 400
- Introduce warning thresholds with warning messages for low levels
- Add more detail to the warning messages, to give an indication of what will happen at the current levels
- low radiation warning: Xenon will be produced at a fast pace, further reducing radioactivity
- Low fuel temp warning: radiation will increase  
- Get v0 to update how to guide
- Get v0 to introduce flashing buttons on UI, and have the relevant figures on the readouts flash when threasholds are met
