FIXES TO MAKE:
 

- Full review of all UI, checking wording, designs
- Test adding background picture for game page
- AZ5 button changes when I hover but doesn't change back after moving mouse away

MECHANIC CHANGES:

- Review all mechnics that use flat change values and consider making them proportional to the thing they are affected by, similar to how steam is worked out. That way everything is more exponential
- Consider increasing affect all all factors, maintani balance but ensuring things move out of balance faster

OPTION NEW FUNCTIONALITY:

- change turbine modal so there is the option to power pumps. If on, the number of pumps that are powered is based on power station power geneartion.
