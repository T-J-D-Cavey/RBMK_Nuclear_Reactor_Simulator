R B M K - Nuclear Reactor Simulation

Manage a nuclear reactor in real-time. Control the forces involved to meet power targets and avoid a nuclear disaster. [Open the Simulation here](https://rbmk-simulator.vercel.app/)

Objective

Your goal is to maintain a stable RBMK reactor at optimal performance. You must generate enough electricity to meet the dynamic power targets set by the district grid while preventing the reactor temperature from exceeding safe limits.

You are tasked with balancing multiple volatile variables including radioactivity, reactor temperature, steam volume, uranium fuel temperature, and xenon poisoning levels.

Controls

Control Rods (×10)
- Function: Boron rods act as the primary brake for radioactivity.
- Usage: Adjust insertion percentage (0-100%) via the control panel.
- AZ-5 (Scram): Immediately inserts all rods fully. Use only in emergencies.
- ⚠️ WARNING - The Graphite Tip Effect: Be extremely careful when reinserting fully removed control rods. Due to a design flaw in the RBMK reactor, the graphite tips of the rods may cause a momentary, dangerous spike in radioactivity and steam generation before the boron takes effect.

Water Pumps (×4)
- Function: Circulate cooling water from the sea through the core to reduce reactor temperature.
- Usage: Toggle pumps ON/OFF via the control panel.
- Power Dependency: Pumps require electricity to function. If the station suffers a power cut, pumps will fail.
- Risk: If pumps are unpowered or turned off, stagnant water will rapidly boil into steam, causing a massive spike in radioactivity (Positive Void Coefficient).

Turbine
- Function: Converts steam into electricity for the district.
- Usage: Connect/Disconnect via the control panel.
- Grid Management: If power generation exceeds grid capacity, you must disconnect the turbine to prevent grid damage. Watch for the warning light on the panel.

Key Metrics & Physics

Understanding the feedback loops inside the core is essential for survival.

Radioactivity
The measure of nuclear reaction rate.
- Increases with: High Steam volume (Positive Void Coefficient), Low Fuel Temperature.
- Decreases with: Boron Control Rod insertion, Xenon buildup.

Reactor Temperature
Generated by the radioactive reaction.
- Relation: High radioactivity leads to high temperatures.
- Cooling: Managed by active Water Pumps.
- Meltdown: Occurs at 1200°. Avoid at all costs.

Steam Volume
Steam drives the turbine but is dangerous in the core.
- Generation: Begins when Reactor Temperature > ~90°.
- Positive Void Coefficient: As steam increases, it facilitates the nuclear reaction, creating more radioactivity, which creates more heat, which creates more steam. This is a deadly feedback loop.

Fuel Temperature & Xenon
- Negative Temperature Coefficient: Cool uranium is more reactive; hot uranium is less reactive. This change happens slowly.
- Xenon Pit: If the reactor runs at low power for too long, xenon gas builds up, poisoning the reaction. To escape a xenon pit, reduce fuel temperature and carefully withdraw control rods.

Performance & Scoring

You must keep power generation within 10% of the current target.
- Success: Consistent power generation yields a high performance score.
- Failure: If your performance drops to 0%, you will be removed from your post as Chief Reactor Controller.

Random Events
Be prepared for unexpected variables:
1. Target Change: The grid demands more or less power suddenly.
2. Power Cut: External power fails, disabling water pumps.
3. Stuck Rods: Mechanical failure prevents rod movement.

Game Over Conditions

1. MELTDOWN: Reactor Temperature reaches 1200°.
2. PERFORMANCE FAILURE: Performance score drops to 0%.



FIXES TO MAKE:
 
- Add sounds affects, and an ability to turn sounds on / off from the homepage and gamepage https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/alarm%20siren/
- Update CSS colours so reactor blue is primary, and set an affective background etc, there should be consistency in colour of buttons matching reactor blue
- When selecting 'try again' it should remember the dificulty setting
- AZ5 button changes when I hover but doesn't change back after moving mouse away
- Add in a way to go back (or close the modal) on the dificulty settings modal
- Udate icons used in the game over or success modals, replace these with the images being used in the game page, using the same opacity settings
- tidy up commented out code and unused components (reactor display etc)


OPTION NEW FUNCTIONALITY:

- change turbine modal so there is the option to power pumps. If on, the number of pumps that are powered is based on power station power geneartion.
