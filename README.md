## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

**[https://vercel.com/tim-caveys-projects/v0-chernobyl](https://vercel.com/tim-caveys-projects/v0-chernobyl)**

## Build your app

Continue building your app on:

**[https://v0.app/chat/eZ4dpLZrJcL](https://v0.app/chat/eZ4dpLZrJcL)**

## How It Works

1. Create and modify your project using [v0.app](https://v0.app)
2. Deploy your chats from the v0 interface
3. Changes are automatically pushed to this repository
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from this repository


FIXES TO MAKE:
 
- Add a minimum width to the root element so it doesn't cause overflow on very small screens, x-scroll is better
- Consider changes to reactor display. We could switch to using a more complex, realistic image and remove the ability for the user to interact with it directly. We can use an image, then create different versions for when the pumps are on. The control rods UI could be fully removed in this scenario
- Full review of all UI, checking wording, designs
- AZ5 button changes when I hover but doesn't change back after moving mouse away
- Add in a way to go back (or close the modal) on the dificulty settings modal
- Udate icons used in the game over or success modals


OPTION NEW FUNCTIONALITY:

- change turbine modal so there is the option to power pumps. If on, the number of pumps that are powered is based on power station power geneartion.
