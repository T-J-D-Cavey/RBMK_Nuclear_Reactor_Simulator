## Overview

This repository will stay in sync with your deployed chats on [v0.app](https://v0.app).
Any changes you make to your deployed app will be automatically pushed to this repository from [v0.app](https://v0.app).

## Deployment

Your project is live at:

**[https://vercel.com/tim-caveys-projects/v0-chernobyl](https://vercel.com/tim-caveys-projects/v0-chernobyl)**

## Build your app

Continue building your app on:

**[https://v0.app/chat/eZ4dpLZrJcL](https://v0.app/chat/eZ4dpLZrJcL)**

## How It Works

1. Create and modify your project using [v0.app](https://v0.app)
2. Deploy your chats from the v0 interface
3. Changes are automatically pushed to this repository
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from this repository


FIXES TO MAKE:

- Increase the base radiation slightly (so it it naturally more radioative, only a little bit)
- Reduce the affect of Xenon on radioactivity a bit 
- SLightly slow down the generation of Xenon at very low radioactivity 
- When radioactivity is 0, reactor temp should cool down much faster
- Increase the affect of low fuel temp on radioactivity
- Increase the speed at which fuel temp changed in relation to reactor temp
- Change max radioactivity level, it's currently maxxes out at 400
- Get v0 to update how to guide
- Get v0 to introduce flashing buttons on UI, and have the readouts flash when threasholds are met
